Artificial Intelligent ChatBot using Tensorflow and NLP that understand the Context and Intent of Human Language
A chatbot is a computer program that is designed to simulate conversation with human users, typically through text-based interfaces such as messaging applications or websites. Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and interpret user inputs and generate responses that simulate human conversation.

Chatbots can be designed to perform a wide range of tasks, such as answering customer service queries, providing information, guiding users through a process, or even carrying out transactions. They can be integrated into various platforms, including websites, mobile apps, messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, and voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

Chatbots offer several benefits, including 24/7 availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. They can handle a large volume of requests simultaneously, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex tasks. Additionally, chatbots can provide a consistent experience for users, ensuring that everyone receives the same level of service and information.

However, chatbots also have some limitations. They may not be able to understand complex requests or nuances in language, and they may struggle with sarcasm, humor, or colloquialisms. As a result, it's important to design chatbots carefully and provide users with clear options for escalating to human support if needed
